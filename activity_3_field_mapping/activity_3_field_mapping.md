# Field Mapping

In the previous activity you gained experience mapping your neighborhood by remote mapping. Tracing satellite imagery makes it really easy to capture buildings and roads quickly. Adding these features improve the basemap, and make it easier for others to add additional data at a later point in time. Since you were familiar with your neighborhood, you were also able to add Points of Interest and other attributes that one could not identify from satellite imagery alone.

When mapping is only done by mapping remotely, many details are often missed such as cultural features, businesses, road names, and more. Field mapping can be how you gain the local context for more detailed mapping. Some existing tools that assist with field mapping are Field Papers, OpenMapKit, and Mapillary.

### Mapillary (https://www.mapillary.com/)
Mapillary is an app compatible with both Android and iPhone where you can take ground-level geo-tagged photos. With Mapillary you can capture street photos when you walk, ride your bike or drive. Once you upload the photos to Mapillary they are available for map editing on OpenStreetMap. The photos are useful for capturing features you canâ€™t see on satellite imagery like building information, road conditions, traffic signs etc. See the Mapillary Showcase (https://www.mapillary.com/showcase) to learn earn how cities, agencies, companies, and NGOs use Mapillary imagery and map data.

Above is my location on the mapillary home screen, green indicated what has already been mapped by users.

Here is what the camera view looks like while you are activly mapping. The UI will alert you to poor GPS signal and when your orientation is not level.

When exploring the map, mapillary shows you both the imagery as well as the top-down view of the map. You can also switch on the top-down map view as you activly intake images during your project.

You can see when your images have been uploaded in your profile tab. This shows you what is being uploaded and when it is eventually published. This takes lots of battery and cellular data from your device. I heavily suggest you only upload while your phone is on Wifi and charging.

### Field Papers (http://fieldpapers.org/)
Field Papers allow you to make your own printable atlas before you go out in the field. The atlas allows you to make notes and observations in the field. After Field mapping you can take a photograph of your atlas and overlay the atlas in the OpenStreetMap iD editor to complete your edits.

Select "make yourself an atlas" from the Field Papers homepage

Here is the atlas creation page over my current location. Orient whichever square you wish to use to map over the central locsation you will be exploring. The other square can be used to take notes.

Below is what my final atlas looked like for mapping south central Los Angeles.

### OpenMapKit (http://openmapkit.org/) 
{insert screenshot}
OpenMapKit (OMK) is an extension of OpenDataKit allowing users to create professional quality mobile data collection surveys for field data collection. OMK allows you to include standard OpenStreetMap tags in your survey. In the field you can create new Points of Interest by simply dropping pins and adding tags. 

## Assignment: Field Mapping with Mapillary
You will be mapping your local neighborhood with Mapillary. We will follow a simple process: 1) Capture photos 2) Upload photos 3) Explore places and 4) Edit in OpenStreetMap

When field mapping, be sure to follow adequate safety precautions. Obey all traffic rules, be aware of your surroundings, and do not trespass on private property. Do you venture into unsafe areas, and being along a friend if you feel uncomfortable mapping alone. 

- Review the Mapillary OSM Editing Guide (https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2016/05/24/use-mapillary-editing-OSM.html) and follow steps 1, 2, and 3. 

- Then watch the Mapillary iD Editor video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v-gz-JHkbw) to learn how to edit in OpenStreetMap using Mapillary photos.

- Spend at a minimum 40 minutes in the field using Mapillary to capture ground photos and sequences. Then upload your photos to Mapillary. Look out for capturing interesting things you would like to see mapped, including buildings and signs.

- Edit OpenStreetMap using the iD editor and turn on the Mapillary Photo Overlay. 

- Using the extra information create at least 5 new building or add attributes to existing buildings including a name and number of levels. If applicable, change the building type of a more specific one (e.g. commercial building, industrial, residential). Also if applicable add an amenity tag to better describe buildings (e.g. house of worship, school, restaurant). {add screenshot of side menu with relevant fields highlighted}

- Using the extra information create at least 5 new roads or add attributes to existing roads including a name and number of lanes. If applicable, add a road number, speed limit, and surface type. {add screenshot of side menu with relevant fields highlighted}

- Submit your Mapillary user name for the assignment and a written assignment (min 250 words) describing your experience. Here are some though-provoking questions to help you with your written assignment:
  - Is field mapping easy or hard? 
  - Did you run into any roadblocks or have any questions while field mapping or editing? 
  - Could you scale field mapping for a whole city with multiple people? 
  - How do you think Machine Learning or automation may make things easier to map?
