# Advanced Editing in OSM using JOSM

Want to level up our mapping? Many advanced users use the [JOSM editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM) for improved editing efficiency or specialized needs. JOSM is built using Java, and it is easy to install on your Windows or Mac, or you can launch it from your machine without installing it. Only Java is needed, for either option get started by going to the [JOSM website](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/).
